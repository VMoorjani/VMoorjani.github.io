        <p>Hi, My name is Vishal Moorjani. I am a senior studying Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>
        
        <p>I'm interested in working on projects related to AI, hardware, and ideally the intersection of the two.</p>

        <p>I intend to work on solving 3 problems with AI tools today which are broadly:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                They cannot reliably take action on your behalf.
            </li>
            <li>
                They do not reliably remember things about you.
            </li>
            <li>
                They are too slow and energy intensive.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>I worked on some of the above while at Automorphic, and I intend to explore some of them in my own time. 
            I intend on using this website to <a href="blog.html">blog</a> while working on different <a href="blog.html">projects</a>, 
            or while I am learning new things, partly to keep track of my progress, partly as a version control system for my thoughts while working on things, 
            and partly to show other people what I find interesting.</p>
