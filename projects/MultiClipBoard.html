            <p>It's been a while since I've written anything in Swift so it took me a little bit to get back into it. But, it works. I didn't realise how many keys were actually mapped to shortcuts, so the 
                most frustrating part was figuring out which ones I could use. I've now trippled my clipboard size. I can use command + j to copy something, and command + shift + j to paste it.
                Same for m. There's still some stuff that I haven't figured out.
                1. Whenever I open the app it shows me the permissions view, I know why but I don't know how to fix it yet (I ran into some syntax errors with my fix)
                2. I imagine this is helpful to run in the background, so how do I do that? 
                3. I feel like it should allow you to pick your key combinations. For example, what if someone else has m and j mapped to things, they should be able to use control or something else. 

                I can add these in along the way, but for now it works. Also a quick note, the command + c and command + v keys shown after the j and m ones are simulated keypresses, and command + c/v works the same.

            <p>I was going through my AWS stuff the other day and found that I had a bunch of S3 buckets that were around from the Nash days 
                (If there was more stuff there, this could have been the most expensive mistake of my life). To delete a bucket,
                you first need to empty it, so there is some prompt that requires you to confirm that you want to empty it, and then to delete it
                you need to type the bucket name. Since they were created by amplify and I used the default names they were very long. So, I wanted to keep
                permanantly delete copied, and then copy the name of the bucket and go along. However you can't copy 2 things at once. I imagine there are 
                probbaly use cases for where this is useful, and since I have some time when I am not working on the FPGALLM stuff or class, I figured I can 
                spend it on this. I have some idea for how I I think it will work and I don't think it'll be too hard. I'm also going to start by implementing it for mac (even though I use a PC)
                because I haven't written in Swift for very long, and a friend of mine told me that she wanted it too and she uses a mac.
                Much like the PC iOS Airdrop, I haven't done anything yet, but I'm putting this here so I don't procrastinate.
