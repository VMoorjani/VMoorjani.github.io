            <p>I was going through my AWS stuff the other day and found that I had a bunch of S3 buckets that were around from the Nash days 
                (If there was more stuff there, this could have been the most expensive mistake of my life). To delete a bucket,
                you first need to empty it, so there is some prompt that requires you to confirm that you want to empty it, and then to delete it
                you need to type the bucket name. Since they were created by amplify and I used the default names they were very long. So, I wanted to keep
                permanantly delete copied, and then copy the name of the bucket and go along. However you can't copy 2 things at once. I imagine there are 
                probbaly use cases for where this is useful, and since I have some time when I am not working on the FPGALLM stuff or class, I figured I can 
                spend it on this. I have some idea for how I I think it will work and I don't think it'll be too hard. I'm also going to start by implementing it for mac (even though I use a PC)
                because I haven't written in Swift for very long, and a friend of mine told me that she wanted it too and she uses a mac.
                Much like the PC iOS Airdrop, I haven't done anything yet, but I'm putting this here so I don't procrastinate.
