            <p> I still haven't done anything for this, but I think I'm going to start with full finetuning instead of pre-training. The reason for this 
                is that all these different companies like Fox, CBS, Yahoo etc. publish their predictions for the games. These predictions also 
                include the odds etc. from different websites. More importantly, they include information about the teams, players, weather etc. 
                Obviously, this information is useful, but for a model to properly digest all of it it would need a strong base understanding of 
                english. So, I'm going to bank on the inate understanding of language one of the bigger models has, maybe Llama 3.1 8B or Qwen3 8B. 
                I will finetune one of these models on data predicting the outcomes of games. This is a much bigger undertaking than what I had originally 
                planned, because I need to aggregate all the predictions for all the games, along with the innings-by-innings results. I'm not really sure 
                if all these companies keep all their past predictions. I want to do full finetuning instead of any kind of PEFT because it seems harder. 
                I'll perform some kind of PEFT also, just to compare, and at some point I would like to perform pretraining. Once all of this is done, 
                it'll be cool to have some kind of counter on this website that displays how much up or down the model is currently (like if it had bet 
                100 dollars on each of it's predictions, then how much would it have won or lost so far).

            <p> I haven't made any progress on this so far, but while working on the QAT for FPGALLM and looking at SmolLM, I think that I'm going to start 
                with the SmolLM architecture. It's small, but it's hopefully powerful enough for me to get a sense of how this will look. Since I've never trainined 
                anything at even 10M parameter scale before, it will be a fun exercise anyway. I'll start with the SmolLM2-135M model. 
                I'll pre-train on baseball data, and then I'll see how it performs. To judge it's perfomance, obivously I'll see if it gets the scores etc right, 
                but I should really see how well it does on the lines. Even if it's final score prediction is wrong, but it still beats the spread, 
                then that's okay. I also realised that this idea has probably been lying dormant in my head for a while because of a conversation with 
                Aum. He wanted to do something similar. Just to place my expectations on some kind of record, I don't think this will do great. 
                But, I hope that I am surprised.

            <p> I've recently gotten into watching baseball. I also have a friend who bets on baseball, so when I watch 
                games with him I keep up with the lines. I've found that baseball is one of the most unpredictable sports, 
                and being a faourite going into a game doesn't feel like it means as much as it does in other sports.
                I think the problem is that I haven't seen enough baseball to be able to make a good judgement on how 
                accurate the lines are. So, I figured it might be interesting to train a model that can figure out 
                the lines. There are 3 things, money line, run line, and the spread. So, I want to train a model that 
                can predict all 3. I'm going to train a model that will be able to predict the score in any inning. 
                I also want to be able to feed it live data, and have it tune its predictions as the game goes on. I think 
                that autoregressive generation will work for this. Imagine I am making a prediction for Team A vs Team B. 
                Simply giving the model the previous matchups is not enough because it doesn't speak to recent performance. 
                Including recent performance of only these 2 teams, even how they've done against other teams, is also
                not enough because it doesn't include all the information about how good their oponents actually were (
                imagine Team A beat Team C 3-0 but Team C has lost to all other teams 7-0 then the model should know this).
                So, I need a model that allows the predicition for the current game to be informed by all previous games 
                (self-attention), where the model has information about all previous games (pre-training), with a special 
                focus on the most recent games (context window). So, I'm going to use a transformer model. Based on how 
                it looks in my head right now, I'm going to start with a decoder only model, but I might move to an 
                encoder-decoder model. It's called Baseball XM because I don't know how many parameters it will have.
                I want it to be big though, because Malhar tells me that pre-training is a whole different ball game (pun intended).
                I could also finetune a model for prediciton, and use its base understanding of english along with whatever 
                baseball related data it was trained on. I'm not sure which is better, but I'm going to start with a decoder only model. 
                And probably a small one. Then I'll go from there. I won't start work on this until I'm done with FPGALLM, but I 
                just wanted to write this down so I know that I have to get to it as soon as I'm done with FPGALLM.
