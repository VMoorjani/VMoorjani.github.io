            <p> I've recently gotten into watching baseball. I also have a friend who bets on baseball, so when I watch 
                games with him I keep up with the lines. I've found that baseball is one of the most unpredictable sports, 
                and being a faourite going into a game doesn't feel like it means as much as it does in other sports.
                I think the problem is that I haven't seen enough baseball to be able to make a good judgement on how 
                accurate the lines are. So, I figured it might be interesting to train a model that can figure out 
                the lines. There are 3 things, money line, run line, and the spread. So, I want to train a model that 
                can predict all 3. I'm going to train a model that will be able to predict the score in any inning. 
                I also want to be able to feed it live data, and have it tune its predictions as the game goes on. I think 
                that autoregressive generation will work for this. Imagine I am making a prediction for Team A vs Team B. 
                Simply giving the model the previous matchups is not enough because it doesn't speak to recent performance. 
                Including recent performance of only these 2 teams, even how they've done against other teams, is also
                not enough because it doesn't include all the information about how good their oponents actually were (
                imagine Team A beat Team C 3-0 but Team C has lost to all other teams 7-0 then the model should know this).
                So, I need a model that allows the predicition for the current game to be informed by all previous games 
                (self-attention), where the model has information about all previous games (pre-training), with a special 
                focus on the most recent games (context window). So, I'm going to use a transformer model. Based on how 
                it looks in my head right now, I'm going to start with a decoder only model, but I might move to an 
                encoder-decoder model. It's called Baseball XM because I don't know how many parameters it will have.
                I want it to be big though, because Malhar tells me that pre-training is a whole different ball game (pun intended).
                I could also finetune a model for prediciton, and use its base understanding of english along with whatever 
                baseball related data it was trained on. I'm not sure which is better, but I'm going to start with a decoder only model. 
                And probably a small one. Then I'll go from there. I won't start work on this until I'm done with FPGALLM, but I 
                just wanted to write this down so I know that I have to get to it as soon as I'm done with FPGALLM.
